## Principles of designing effective IAM solutions:
Designing effective IAM solutions requires adhering to key principles that ensure security, efficiency, and scalability. As an IAM developer, you need to understand these principles in order to craft solutions that meet TechCorp's unique needs:

_**Least privilege principle:**_ Ensure that users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. This minimises the risk of unauthorised access and data breaches.

_**Role-based access control (RBAC):**_ Implement RBAC to assign permissions based on user roles. This simplifies access management and reduces administrative overhead.
  
_**User lifecycle management:**_ Develop processes to manage user accounts throughout their lifecycle, including onboarding, role changes, and offboarding. This ensures that user access aligns with current status and responsibilities.

_**Strong authentication:**_ Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access.

_**Audit and monitoring:**_Incorporate robust auditing and monitoring mechanisms to track user activities and detect anomalies or unauthorised access.
